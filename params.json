{"body":"Maven Inspector\r\n==============\r\nAs much as Maven makes it easy to deal with builds, the plethora of XML and the varying life cycles phases can sometimes make it hard to figure out what a build will actually do.\r\n\r\nTo help with this, I've created the \"Maven Inspector\" plugin for Eclipse. This simple plugin provides an eclipse view called \"Maven Execution\" that presents for a given pom the phases and associated MOJOs.\r\n\r\nHow to install it?\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to use it?\r\n--------------\r\nThe Maven execution view shows information about the POM file being edited. To use it:\r\n- Open the Maven Execution view.\r\n- Open a pom file.\r\n\r\nThe content of the view is refreshed when the pom file is saved.\r\n\r\nThe \"pin\" option available from the view toolbar is useful when you are modifying a parent pom but want to keep focus on a \"child\" pom to see the effect of the changes.","google":"UA-33366905-1","tagline":"Figure out what a pom will do","note":"Don't delete this file!
